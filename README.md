## Twitch Modbot vs. Spambot Simulation (EECS-4461 Winter 2025 Group 5)

This repo is the group project of EECS-4461 Winter 2025 group 5
This project explores the ongoing battle between Twitch mod bots and spambots using Agent-Based Modeling (ABM). On live-streaming platforms like Twitch, chat rooms serve as primary spaces for interaction, but they are also vulnerable to spambot invasions. Mod bots work to enforce chat rules by filtering messages, issuing warnings, and blocking spambots, while spambots continuously evolve to bypass detection through message manipulation and human-like behavior. Our project models these interactions using agent-based simulations to understand the dynamics of AI-vs-AI moderation and AI-to-human interactions. The research findings can contribute to better automated moderation strategies, improved spam detection, and enhanced user experiences on live-streaming and social media platforms.
