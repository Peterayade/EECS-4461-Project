## **Goals**
Our goal is to complete the EECS 4461 team project as a united group, fostering friendly and efficient cooperation. This deliverable establishes our foundation by defining team roles, setting expectations, and outlining our research topic. Through the Team Expectations Document, we ensure clear collaboration, while the Topic Idea Document formalizes our chosen phenomenon, demonstrating AI-to-AI and AI-to-human interactions. By integrating background research and project infrastructure, we aim to achieve strong results while maintaining effective teamwork.
